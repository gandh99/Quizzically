## Useful notes

1. Encrypting secrets in application.yml. The encrypted value for the secret can be generated using the following code.
```
java -cp ~/.m2/repository/org/jasypt/jasypt/1.9.2/jasypt-1.9.2.jar org.jasypt.intf.cli.JasyptPBEStringEncryptionCLI input=‚ÄùTopsecret@123" password=dev-env-secret algorithm=PBEWITHMD5ANDDES
```
If the jasypt-1.9.2.jar executable is located somewhere else, fret not. Open your IDE and under the External Libraries folder locate the org.jasypt:jasypt:1.9.2 folder. Expand this folder, right click on the jasypt-1.9.2.jar file, and select "Directory Path". Use this directory path to execute the JAR file. For me, my JAR was located in /mnt/c/... . Use the encrypted output as the value in the application.yml file. Lastly, configure the Java VM as such: -Djasypt.encryptor.password=SECRET_KEY.
